# RTXFinder

## npm start will run with Founders Edition price (739â‚¬) and show price for every GPU regardless of stock.
Small NodeJS project using Axios & Cheerio, made to check availability of NVIDIA RTX 3080 GPU (mostly out of stock as of December 2020) from various Finnish retailers. 
script takes 2 parameters: max price and "y" if you want to see the price for the out of stock GPUs. Otherwise price will be shown only for the GPUs that are available.
